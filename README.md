# BB84 QKD Implementation

## About this Project

This project aims to implement the BB84 QKD protocol using Python and Numpy.
Currently has a basic BB84 implementation allowing users to create and send bits to each other.

## Stuff To Do

- [x] Implement a basic quantum API
- [x] Implement a basic BB84 flow
- [x] Implement a eavesdropper and see their effects
- [ ] Create a socket-like protocol for communication across programs

## Simple Quantum Protocol (SQP)

A goofy ahh protocol I created for this project. It probably has a lot of
loopholes, bugs and critical security issues, but I am too lazy to figure it out.
Please do not use this for any production apps thanks üôè

This documentation is a work in progress.

### Message Layout

The SQP message should contain the following fields:

- Method: The method type, i.e.: `GET`, `RES`, `ERR`
- Target: The hostname of the receiver
- Sender: The hostname of the sender
- Data: Data to be transferred, can be left as an empty string
