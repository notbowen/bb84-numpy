# BB84 QKD Implementation

## About this Project

This project aims to implement the BB84 QKD protocol using Python and Numpy.
Currently has a basic BB84 implementation allowing users to create and send bits to each other.

## Stuff To Do

- [x] Implement a basic quantum API
- [x] Implement a basic BB84 flow
- [ ] Implement a eavesdropper and see their effects
- [ ] Create a socket-like protocol for communication across programs
